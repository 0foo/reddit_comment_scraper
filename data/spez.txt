I was even on call with Ben early on and it was pretty clear then that this is a huge financial issue for Reddit\u2014companies like OpenAI and Google are making bank off Reddit data and that\u2019s gotta end. And you know what? I\u2019m sympathetic to that! ChatGPT has created a lot of really unfun work for the sub I help moderate, r/AskHistorians. I also get that Reddit is a business and needs to make money. \nBut data\u2019s not your only asset. So are your volunteer moderators. While Facebook has a larger user base than Reddit, it spends over 500 million a year on content moderation. Maybe you saw this study my colleagues published last year? That\u2019s the absolute lowest estimate, based on modlog data alone. That doesn\u2019t even begin to cover the hours spent answering modmails, or deliberating with other mods or alone over a contentious decision. It doesn\u2019t account for the time it takes to send reports to you when we exhaust what we can do with our tools, the emotional labour of dealing with hurt or abusive users, the care that goes into carefully crafting policies that work for our communities, or the engagement we have with users to encourage them to keep coming back to our communities and your site. There\u2019s a lot of value added that volunteer moderation provides over commercial content moderation. I could go on and on about that, but in short, the individual communities and the leaders who manage them are what makes Reddit stand out from all the other, increasingly homogenizing, social media platforms. \nSo my first question for you is: what are your plans to invest in that asset? \nBecause it really feels like, from the outside, that supporting that asset hasn\u2019t been a priority for Reddit\u2019s leadership. In 2015 mods protested and Reddit apologized, promising to work on mod tooling. In 2019 you promised that chat would always be an opt-in feature but a year later an unmoderated chat feature was made a default feature on most subs. In 2020, in response to moderators protesting racism on Reddit you yourself promised to support mods in combating hate. And then in 2021, again Reddit promised tooling to support mods confronting mis/disinformation. While there\u2019s definitely been progress made since 2020, here we are in 2023, freaked out about the API because mods rely on critical infrastructure that\u2019s mostly a cobbled together patchwork of mod-developed tools, third party apps (and increasingly, Reddit-provided tools). But here we are still waiting for Reddit to make good on promises that started eight years ago. We know your dev team has been working their asses off trying to clean up this mess and playing catchup. And yet there\u2019s news that you\u2019re planning on letting go 5% of your employees. \nSo my second question for you is: what are you doing to insure your teams can succeed?"}, {"comment_title": "Addressing the community about changes to our API", "comment_text": "Apologies for the delay.

Or at least a \"get x requests free for non commercial use, otherwise talk to us for commercial usage\" policy with profit sharing built in?\nGives an escape hatch for freeware tool developers, helps cash in on AI, and gives freemium apps an incentive to monetize knowing they don't have to \"cover costs\" so much as they just need to cut you in on the profits.

I'm 36, and I went through a phase about a year ago where I wanted to get more disciplined about working out because I wanted to see more consistent progress. I got on a consistent routine, started tracking more, ate better, and generally became more intentional with exercise. I started making progress and was really enjoying myself. However, it seemed like every time I was really getting into the groove, I'd pull, strain, or otherwise hurt something and then be out of commission for a while for a couple of weeks.\nThere are two things that have really helped, and I can say happily that I've been relatively injury free for a while and the setbacks I have had are for days not weeks.\nThe first is physical. I've really embraced warming up. I used to think that a long warmup would exhaust me and prevent me from performing well for the meat of the workout. Instead, now I think about how I can't perform my best unless unless my heart is moving, my blood is flowing, and everything is fully activated. For any particular exercise\u2014especially if I'm going to try and push it that day\u2014I do a bunch (4+) warmup sets to really get things going, and instead of telling myself that I'm a little tired, I tell myself that I'm warmed up and ready to go.\nThe second is mental. I used to tell myself that I'm getting older and injuries are just part of things now, and even worse, that when I hurt myself that it'll take a long time to heal because I'm older. I can guarantee if that if that's what you tell yourself, that will be your experience. On the other hand, I've found that if I don't accept that reality that I can both avoid injury generally and bounce back quickly when I do hurt something. If I tweak something, I go back to that muscle the very next day\u2014usually with a lighter weight and being super intentional about good form\u2014and prove to myself that the injury isn't going to be a factor. I've bounced back a couple times in days from what used to take me weeks in the past.\nPlease include a reasonable disclaimer about me not being a professional.

This is a good question, and it's definitely something we\u2019ve struggled with.\nAs Reddit grew but our anti-spammer and anti-bot preventions didn\u2019t, many subreddits implemented account karma and age minimums as a stopgap effort. Since then, we\u2019ve built much more powerful tools that action the majority of spam and bot accounts automatically (note the word \"majority\" there; we're not perfect!), however many of these rules remain intact. Unfortunately, that means that often these rules are punishing newbie redditors who legitimately want to participate\u2026but their first experience with Reddit is their content being removed, and sometimes silently if the mods haven\u2019t set up automod to notify them. This can make it very hard for newbies to get involved in Reddit and in various communities even if they have quality contributions. We don\u2019t want an echo chamber, so we want a way for newbies to (respectfully, while following the rules) contribute. Karma subreddits are a stopgap created by users, and obviously there are downsides there. We\u2019re looking at some ideas now to try to address the problem in a way that prevents spam and trolling while allowing newbies to contribute. If we can accomplish that, then ideally both karma minimum rules AND karma subreddits can go away.\nWe're always looking for new and better solves though, so please comment if you have any ideas!\n\nNot sure if there's been an change in opinion or policy since then."}, {"comment_title": "Spring forward\u2026 into Reddit\u2019s 2019 transparency report", "comment_text": "While I agree with the spirit of your statement, the reality is we have plenty of moderators who do a good job and can handle the workload.

As a result, r/science and the other defaults had high visibility at the expense of non-default communities.\nr/science used to promote AMAs by removing other more popular posts so that the AMA could be top of r/science without the votes. This, combined with being a default community, sent a lot of traffic to these AMAs.\nHow it works today\nWe replaced the defaults with r/popular, which is basically a SFW version of r/all. This puts all communities on an equal footing.\nWe don't allow the post manipulation for obvious reasons. Here is a discussion we had with u/nallen on this topic months ago.\nWe are indeed testing new sorting algorithms, but if anything they should help communities like r/science get more visibility. One of our engineers recently wrote a pretty good post about it.\nGoing forward\nRegardless of u/nallen's decision, we will continue to work to improve our onboarding and sorting so that users get to see more of what they love, and we have in mind some specific features that will help promote \"event\" posts (AMAs, game threads, episode threads) in the future.", "comment_id": "t1_dz8nky8", "comment_context_link": "https://old.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8khscc/rscience_will_no_longer_be_hosting_amas/dz8nky8/?context=3", "comment_parent": "Wonder if u/spez cares that Reddit is losing a well loved feature."}, {"comment_title": "Why did they change the reddit to new reddit?", "comment_text": "You can use the old layout indefinitely. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/ and uncheck \"use the redesign as my default experience.\" I know the prefs page is a bit of a mess. It's one of the things we're rebuilding in the redesign. We have no plans to turn off old.reddit.com. \nAs for why:\n\nNew tech stack. The existing codebase is nearly impossible to build in. The redesign gives us a modern platform in which to develop. In the redesign we're able to ship lots of stuff every week. Here's our most recent update.\nEasier to use. r2, our name for the legacy site, is quite difficult to grok. We see and lose a lot of potential users every day because they don't know wtf Reddit is. Engagement in our native apps is 2\u20135x higher even though the content is identical. Part of this is due to the phone form factor, but part of this is do to a more visceral UI.\nAdapt Reddit to its content. When r2 was built, Reddit was 100% outbound links and self-posts. Today, we have a lot more media and have plans to add more post types. The UI should support that.\nAds. In-feed ads are what advertisers want to buy. Yes, they're in-feed, which I know isn't popular, but it also means our top post is an organic post now instead of an ad. We will continue to iterate on the styling.\nPerception. We will no longer have to explain our ancient UI to potential partners, which really was quite a hurdle. Reddit being synonymous with \"old and difficult to use\" isn't good for business.\nPortable styles. I know there's a lot of heat around this one as well, but structured styles allow community styling to work across platforms, which is important given the majority of our traffic today is mobile. It also makes community styling easier and therefore more accessible to more communities.\n\nWe've still got a lot to do, but we started rolling it out because we decided it was good enough to get going, and if we waited until it was perfect, we'd never ship.

Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/ and uncheck \"use the redesign as my default experience.\" I know the prefs page is a bit of a mess. It's one of the things we're rebuilding in the redesign. We have no plans to turn off old.reddit.com. \nAs for why:\n\nNew tech stack. The existing codebase is nearly impossible to build in. The redesign gives us a modern platform in which to develop. In the redesign we're able to ship lots of stuff every week. Here's our most recent update.\nEasier to use. r2, our name for the legacy site, is quite difficult to grok. We see and lose a lot of potential users every day because they don't know wtf Reddit is. Engagement in our native apps is 2\u20135x higher even though the content is identical. Part of this is due to the phone form factor, but part of this is do to a more visceral UI.\nAdapt Reddit to its content. When r2 was built, Reddit was 100% outbound links and self-posts. Today, we have a lot more media and have plans to add more post types. The UI should support that.\nAds. In-feed ads are what advertisers want to buy. Yes, they're in-feed, which I know isn't popular, but it also means our top post is an organic post now instead of an ad. We will continue to iterate on the styling.\nPerception. We will no longer have to explain our ancient UI to potential partners, which really was quite a hurdle. Reddit being synonymous with \"old and difficult to use\" isn't good for business.\nPortable styles. I know there's a lot of heat around this one as well, but structured styles allow community styling to work across platforms, which is important given the majority of our traffic today is mobile. It also makes community styling easier and therefore more accessible to more communities.\n\nWe've still got a lot to do, but we started rolling it out because we decided it was good enough to get going, and if we waited until it was perfect, we'd never ship. Plus, having the user base providing constant \"feedback\" is highly motivating to the team.\nPersonally, I've switched my desktop Reddit-ing to the redesign and am pretty happy.

These accounts generally aren't registered by the people who wind up using them for propaganda purposes, though. In fact, they're often \"farmed\" by call-center-like environments overseas \u2013 popular locations are India, Pakistan, China, Indonesia, and Russia \u2013 then sold to firms that specialize in spinning information (whether for advertising, pushing political agendas, or anything else).\nIf you're interested, this brief guide can give you a primer on how to spot spammers.\nNow, the reason I bring this up is because for every shill account that actually takes off, there are quite literally a hundred more that get stopped in their tracks. A banned account is of very little use to the people who would employ it for nefarious purposes... but the simple truth of the matter is that moderators still need to rely on their subscribers for help. If you see a repost, a low-effort (or poorly written) comment, or something else that just doesn't sit right with you, it's often a good idea to look at the user who submitted it. A surprising amount of the time, you'll discover that the submitter is a karma-farmer; a spammer or a propagandist in the making.\nWhen you spot one, please report it to the moderators of that subReddit.\nReddit has gotten a lot better at cracking down on these accounts behind the scenes, but there's still a long way to go... and as users, every one of us can make a difference, even if it sometimes doesn't seem like it."}, {"comment_title": "Reddit\u2019s 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings", "comment_text": "Thank you for restoring balance.", "comment_id": "t1_dx5k5pm", "comment_context_link": "https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/dx5k5pm/?context=3", "comment_parent": "Thank you for restoring balance."}, {"comment_title": "Reddit\u2019s 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings", "comment_text": "Ah, thanks.

I decided to answer this direct question knowing it would be a difficult one because it comes up on Reddit quite a bit. I\u2019d like to add more nuance to my answer:\nWhile the words and expressions you refer to aren\u2019t explicitly forbidden, the behaviors they often lead to are. \nTo be perfectly clear, while racism itself isn\u2019t against the rules, it\u2019s not welcome here. I try to stay neutral on most political topics, but this isn\u2019t one of them.\nI believe the best defense against racism and other repugnant views, both on Reddit and in the world, is instead of trying to control what people can and cannot say through rules, is to repudiate these views in a free conversation, and empower our communities to do so on Reddit.\nWhen it comes to enforcement, we separate behavior from beliefs. We cannot control people\u2019s beliefs, but we can police their behaviors. As it happens, communities dedicated racist beliefs end up banned for violating rules we do have around harassment, bullying, and violence.\nThere exist repugnant views in the world. As a result, these views may also exist on Reddit. I don\u2019t want them to exist on Reddit any more than I want them to exist in the world, but I believe that presenting a sanitized view of humanity does us all a disservice. It\u2019s up to all of us to reject these views.\nThese are complicated issues, and we may not always agree, but I am listening to your responses, and I do appreciate your perspectives. Our policies have changed a lot over the years, and will continue to evolve into the future. Thank you.\nOriginal response:\nIt's not. On Reddit, the way in which we think about speech is to separate behavior from beliefs. This means on Reddit there will be people with beliefs different from your own, sometimes extremely so. When users actions conflict with our content policies, we take action.\nOur approach to governance is that communities can set appropriate standards around language for themselves.

Every letter is double-checked to be sure everything is printed, enveloped, stamped and sealed properly. A real human does all of this, and a real human goes to the post office every morning and drops them off.

Back in the beginning, we created the 1-in-10 rule, which meant that you were only allowed to submit 1-in-10 pieces of content from the same domain. This was in response to folks who would show up on Reddit, not know their way around, and submit every piece of content from their blog. We only had one community then, and this behavior was considered rude at best, and spam at worst. Keep in mind we had only links back then as well.\nSkip ahead to today, we have many thousands of communities, proper spam prevention, and a massive userbase to curate good content. More than 60% of the content on Reddit exists in self posts. The users who create original, unique, relevant content off-site would be huge on Reddit if their content was in text posts hosted on Reddit instead. The only difference is in hosting. Profile pages are intended to be hosting for these users.\nI was talking to a friend the other night who writes a blog dedicated to news for our neighborhood. It's great content, it would be right at home in a couple of places on Reddit. She is a writer, not a social media expert. I think it's unfair that in addition to creating good content we expect her to source nine other things from around the web so her stuff will be seen by the audience that will probably like it (I'm speaking on behalf of these communities. I'm a part of them). With new profile pages, she can submit her stuff to her profile, and if the relevant communities like it, they can crosspost it in. If they don't, she can build her own following on her profile.

(Live results here)\n\nCalled it.\nI don't support this.\nMany subreddits are different, and have different goals or CSS tweaks. I don't see how this will actually be considered a working replacement? For example if 50 subreddits use CSS to add extra buttons like \"Read FAQ\" below \"Submit a new link\" but the other 4000+ subreddits don't, would the admins actually give this dev time to implement? Are the admins actually going to implement every use case we moderators use CSS for to accomplish functionality? I don't see that being feasible. If not, then this is simple a loss in functionality for many many subreddits.\nSo what, we're just homogenizing Reddit now? And I'm not talking about the visuals, but functionality.\nI can never see one blanket \"theme\" system/style to cover all subreddits working as they used to.\nCSS has accomplished:\n\nFunctionality: /r/Overwatch has subreddit filters\nFunctionality: /r/Dota2 has a list of current livestreams and their # of viewers\nUX: /r/videos has a list of rules where on hover it expands out to explain each rule\nFunctionality: /r/Minecraft has a list of server status (icons) on sidebar\nUX: /r/Hearthstone has notices & links on the top banner\nPersonality: /r/ffxiv has various CSS Easter Eggs to give it a bit more personality\nFunctionality: /r/Starcraft has a \"verified user\" system\nUX: /r/Guildwars2 increased the the size of \"message the moderators\" to make it stand out more\nUX: /r/ffxi has a small tooltip if a user hasn't set a user flair yet\nUX: /r/DarkSouls2 has related subreddits linked on the sidebar with images instead of text\nPersonality: /r/mildlyinfuriating's joke where it slightly rotates \"random\" comment threads\nFunctionality: /r/ClashOfClans not only has a list of livestreams, but thumbnail previews of each\nUX: /r/DarkSouls3 has a reminder when hovering over the downvote button\nPersonality: /r/StarWars has quote popups when you upvote\nUX: /r/pcmasterrace has changed the \"report\" link to red\nUX: /r/explainlikeimfive has custom colored link flair icons\nPersonality: /r/mylittlepony has countless emotes\nPersonality: /r/onepiece has a scrolling banner (which can be paused)\nUX: /r/FinalFantasy has green background stickies to make them stand out\nPersonality: /r/mildlyinteresting has a moving gauge on sidebar\nFunctionality: /r/IASIP has a top menu\nUX: /r/DoctorWho has a light red box on sidebar for new users to read\nUX: /r/gallifrey disables the PM link on \"Created by\" so users focus on modmail\n\nAt the minimum, I see this as taking away the personality each subreddit has. We also lose the ability to control and improve UX, considering the admins have been exceptionally slow to improve any UX (even something like link flair).\nTo be clear, I'm not upset by the fact that the time we spent on our CSS is being made useless. I'm upset that we'll be losing functionality and individual subreddit personality.\n[EDIT] Fellow mods, please remember to be civil here. I may not agree with this decision about CSS, but I still respect the admins and all the hard work they do."}, {"comment_title": "The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools", "comment_text": "I knew someone would do this.
